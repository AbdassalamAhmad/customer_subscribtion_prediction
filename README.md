# customer_subscribtion_prediction Project
This is the mid-term project of the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) held by [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/).
I did a complete ML engineer job from analyzing , preparing the data then training and tuning multiple ML models and finally deploying the best model(XGBoost). If you want to check my other small projects see [this Repo](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/Machine-Learning-Zoomcamp)

# Problem Description
The problem in this project is the prediction of whether potential bank clients will subscribe to the term deposit or not ('yes' or 'no' condition).
